Backstory: Julia grew up in a sheltered household, not really having any friends that weren’t books throughout her elementary, middle, or high school years. Having wanted to see how people were like outside of Maine, Julia applied for a scholarship at the Santa maria college, and she was accepted. However she feels VERY much like a fish out of water in this rather diverse atmosphere, so most days and nights she simply takes online classes within her dorm room, once again falling into the habit of self isolation. Due to this, she doesn’t have a lot of social skills when it comes to people, and even less knowledge about the opposite sex except for the basics.
