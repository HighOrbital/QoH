Backstory: Katherine has, thus far, had a relatively normal middle-class life. Born and raised in Albany she went to a middling
university on the east coast, where she also met her future husband, Maurice Washington. They married soon after they received their
degrees - he in business, she in literature. They had their daughter soon after, and their son soon after that, but that didn’t stop
Katherine from working hard to get her doctorate. When Kalisha was around ten years old they moved to the west coast for Maurice’s
career, in a large apartment in one of the more expensive areas of the city.

It was a move Katherine soon began to regret. Though their combined incomes meant they could live in luxury, her husband became more
and more consumed by his work as the years went by, and she watched helplessly as their children began to hang out with the wrong crowd.
Her daughter became involved with a Black Power movement, while her son simply became a wannabe thug. Katherine turned to work to 
distract herself. When our MC meets her she’s lonely, and growing disillusioned about her marriage. Something he could perfectly turn
to his hand.
