Backstory: Having spent all of her young life with the weight of her culture and religion heavy on her mind, Nia has grown up determined 
to make something of herself. Though she’s a third-generation immigrant, her family is still quite traditionalist in some ways, and she’s 
never had a proper relationship due to the interference of her father and brothers. This means she has a strong independent streak, eager 
to show the world that she won’t let herself by shackled by her culture. She puts on a serious, no-nonsense attitude, one that’s mostly 
genuine, though it also serves to hide her love of anime and nerd culture that she filled her teenage years with in lieu of boys. That 
cultural stigma that drives her ambition also fuels her fantasies - rebelling against the modesty her religion requires, and a feeling 
in the back of her head that she’s less. Should the MC take advantage of this, she will be putty in his hands.
