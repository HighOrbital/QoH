Backstory: Born in the capital of South Korea, Lilly always had a fascination with the more macabre aspects of life. 
While other girls were out playing, she would be inside reading ghost stories. 
While girls in high school were talking about who they liked the most in class, Lilly was watching the most recent documentary on serial killers. 
This seemed to be a trend throughout her life, even when her family had moved to California from South Korea when she was 10 years old. 
Because of this love of the macabre along with a rather obsessive hobby of watching serial killer documentaries, 
Lilly wants to become a psychologist in order not only to help people, but also so she can see the darker parts of humanities psyche.
