Trivia: Friends with [Placeholder for Navajo girl] since both like outdoors, but not for the same reasons. Often goes spending some times with [Placeholder for Navajo Girl], or as she cals it, "going Innawoods". Has a collection of patches she woudln't put on her bag/clothes but enjoys that kind of "autism", so to speak.
Often takes a .22lr handgun/SBR when she goes innawoods with [Placeholder for Navajo girl] for some target practice/"plinking", which her friend enjoys, but not as much as her.
Doesn't drink often but often drinks lots, despite being easily drunk. This leads to funny moments where she think she can speak Russian.
Is extremely fond of her full autism, geniune AK47
