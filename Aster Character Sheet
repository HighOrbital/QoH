Backstory: Daughter of an african dictator, lived a life of luxury, while her countrymen fought over starved field mice. Led an incredibly sheltered life, but instead of becoming spoiled, she became insecure and neurotic, after seeing glimpses of the reality of her country, deals with guilt for her father's actions by blaming white people for everything bad that happens, and romanticizing the image of her father as a heroic guerilla leader...
Sent to America to acquire western education, she at first tried to make friends with the local black population, but was quickly disappointed and put off by them, maybe even disgusted (imagine MLK speech from boondocks). She now reluctantly hangs out with some BLM and Black Panther types, and takes drugs with Rastafarians. Overtly claims to hate white people, hatred born out of her isolated childhood, even though she haven't seen any whites until she arrived in America, but even now she only talked to self hatting BLM wiggers. Meeting with the player character, could change her attitude to whites. Frustrated virgin, thinking about having sex with a white man because of the taboo, and curiosity.
